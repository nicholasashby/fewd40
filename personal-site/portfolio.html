		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<p>I am a music enthusiast, film editor, occasional producer, politico and screen writer living in Oakland, CA. I currently work at the San Francisco Ballet doing web portal management. I previously worked as Executive Assistant at Bright Antenna Records, a full-service indie label from production to marketing with major label distribution. I recently continued my education with a certificate in post-production from the Bay Area Video Coalition and produce original music as well as remixes with my friends and partners at Modern Future. I have experience with both design and production of new media campaigns from start to finish as well as an extensive knowledge of film and music. I have worked as a freelance video editor for a number of years. In my spare time I work on my new-wave inspired solo music and a variety of writing projects.</p>
